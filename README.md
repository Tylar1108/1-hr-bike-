zaap and boom! done! 
N IT DOENST WORK! ðŸ˜­
IG my brother understand bike parts better than me
(my brother is the one who tought me abt bikes, ive mentioned 
this before in the readme of the previous project)
he literally can scribble smt n make bikes in 20 min
while itd take me 4 hrs to draw a good one, 
anyway, this was my attempt at narrowing the 
time frame down to an hour, hope you like it,
